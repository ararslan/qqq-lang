This is the story of legendary bros: BrainSteel and Alex. BrainSteel was a nautilus
and Alex was a bird. Alex wanted to make an entirely useless programming language.
BrainSteel graciously accepted a request for assistance. Together they form the
ultimate human. Alex leaned in close and whispered to BrainSteel. "Dude, you are
really good at C++; you made invaluable contributions to this project. Someday we
will rule Earth. But before we do that we must locate the Branch button. It must
be around here somewhere... Okay I think I found it. Hm. I hear the pitter-patter
of a dog's paws"; now let us ROCK!
